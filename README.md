# Cosmos NFTHUB DAshboard V1
It's LIVE, try it [Here](https://cosmosnfthub.xyz/) 

**A Dashboard in React that displays all your Cosmos NFTs on several Cosmos chains from one single place...**
It simply runs in your browser, no data is stored, no database is required at this stage, wallet connection is offline with Keplr or Leap wallets.

## APIs
Data is collected using Stargaze, Intergaze, BackBoneLabs and Superbolt APIs.
Daodao indexer for staked NFTs. And direct cosmwasm contracts queries when no data available elsewhere.

## Installation commands to run it locally
You need node.js and npm installed to install all dependencies: `npm install`
Then launch the vite.js server: `npm run dev`

## Improvements
*Currently it uses free proxies for CORS in API fetches, could be improved with a dedicated proxy.
*Data could be served faster with a dedicated server and database.
*Ability to connect several wallets
*Non-native tokens balances displayed per chain

**And you're good to go!**

*Feel free to support me by donating any token on Stargaze chain at: `stars1d2y72xglnyrphze97kqfmccysdqpf4996srcyj`*

**ENJOY!**
